Project Description

This project is a personal exercise where I recreated a website originally designed and built by the talented developer Brittany Chiang. The purpose of this exercise was to enhance my skills in web development and gain hands-on experience in building visually appealing and responsive websites.

During the development process, I practiced and implemented key front-end technologies, including:

HTML for structuring the content
CSS for styling and layout
JavaScript for adding interactivity
This project has contributed significantly to my journey as a web developer by allowing me to focus on creating clean, maintainable code while also improving my understanding of modern web design principles.

By completing this project, Iâ€™ve not only honed my technical skills but also added a valuable experience to my portfolio of web development exercises.
